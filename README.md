## Hostel review system

In VIT, one has the choice of selecting the hostel of their choice. Priority is given to those with higher GPAs.

This project was created to allow users to help each other in making informed decisions.

This project featurs a login system, using which users can leave ratings and reviews about hostels they've stayed in before.

Admins can curate content that will provide users with the data they need to make their choices. Information primarily includes proximity to academic buildings, noise levels due to nearby construction, mess food quality, bathroom hygiene etc.
